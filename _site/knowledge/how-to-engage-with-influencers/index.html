<h2 id="why-you-must-engage-with-influencers">Why you must engage with influencers</h2>

<p>The end objective of every content marketing initiative is to reach the right target audience, interact with them and get them to talk about your product and/or campaign. As a marketer, you do not leave any stone unturned to make sure that these objectives are achieved. Right from meticulously planning your editorial calendar to making sure your content is consumed by the right people in the right way, you do all you can to ensure that your campaign is successful. However, reaching the right audience and engaging with them constructively can sometimes be quite a task. This is where you can take help from influencers.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-influencers">Who are influencers?</h3>

<p>Influencers are those people who are fairly knowledgeable about a certain topic or a wide range of topics and can impact decisions of the audiences you wish to target. With the advent of social media, the clout of influencers has grown bigger than before and has the ability to make or break a band.</p>

<h3 id="why-engage-with-influencers">Why engage with influencers?</h3>

<p>Influencers usually have tens of thousands, and sometimes even lakhs, of followers on social media. There are people who hang on to every word they say. Given the tremendous reach they have, the right kind of influencer can work wonders for your brand. Besides, getting an influencer on board will only ensure that your audiences have an enriched interaction with your brand.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-choose-the-right-influencer">How to choose the right influencer?</h3>

<p>Remember, itâ€™s not always about the follower count on social media, though it is a crucial factor. Choose an influencer who is relevant to your content marketing campaign, whose personality suits your brand and one who can help you reach the right target audience.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-brand-what-do-you-gain-by-engaging-with-influencers">As a brand, what do you gain by engaging with influencers?</h3>

<p>Influencers humanize your brand and give it that much needed personal touch. This helps people connect better with your brand. A big reason behind the success of many brands is positive word of mouth. Given that influencers interact regularly with their followers by way of social media and blogs, they are able to create the buzz that is needed to get people to talk about your brand.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-engage-with-influencers-1">How to engage with influencers?</h3>

<p>This is the tricky bit. Engagement with influencer has to be win-win for both the parties. The influencer should have something interesting to share with his/her audience and you should be able to seamlessly integrate your brand in that interesting content. Typically, the brand should help the influencer reach out to what that interesting content could be. One interesting way an FMCG brand engages with its influencers is through a tailor made newsletter. As influencers are ahead of the curve compared to other followers; the brand curates interesting content for the influencers/ bloggers from across the world of beauty and shares it as ideas for the influencer posts each week. It is a win-win for both the parties as the influencers keep getting fresh ideas that they might have missed on and the brand retain top of mind recall amongst the influencers.</p>
