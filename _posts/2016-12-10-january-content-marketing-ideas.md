            <p>The first half of the month of the brand-new year, January – the time of international mourning for overindulgence from Christmas through New Years – is the month of bloated tummies, unrecognizable mirror reflections, empty wallets, and renewed hope (for a year intended to be an upgrade on the last).</p>
            <p>The second half of the month is when those New Year resolutions are being pursued with much vigor and the world has lesser flab than the earlier fortnight.</p>
            <p>Let’s look at what your readers are thinking this month and how your brands can use these content pegs to boost engagement and add value to your readers’ lives.</p>
            <p>We’ve rounded up not one or two but <b style="color: #FF4500">18 things you can talk about this January !</b></p>
        </span>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">1. Health and Lifestyle:</b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“I should get a gym membership, drink semi-lethal quantities of water, and dust that cobweb from the sports equipment I bought in 2013”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/health_fitness.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Come January and <b>positive health and lifestyle changes are top of your audience’s mind</b> and the fresh start to the year sends your readers on a resolution-making spree.</p>
            <p>Content around <b>‘5 sneaky ways to get good deals on gym memberships’ ‘A broke girl’s guide to dropping 10 kg’ ‘5 healthy DIY alternatives to your favorite junk food’ ‘3 fun ways to stay fit (Hint: it doesn’t involve gym!)’</b> etc. will be instant conversation starters.</p>
            <p>Brands can also think out of the box to align campaign with their individual objectives. For instance, last year Cancer Research UK, a registered charity encouraged people to have an alcohol-free January. Their campaign Dryathlon featured a special song challenging people to have fun without alcohol throughout the month, and it was played both on TV and across the digital space.</p>
            <p>This is also the time when your readers are deciding to make positive lifestyle changes like learning a new skill/language, organizing their house/wardrobe, reconnecting with old friends, starting yoga/meditation, quitting a bad habit, so content around these topics would likely trend.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">2. Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Watching 5 seasons of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. straight is a sort of marathon, right?”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/marathon.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Everyone knows what happens on the third Sunday of every January. The Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon (SCMM) not just brings the Forest Gumps of the country but also the Bollywood brigade, business tycoons, sports personalities, and your amateur next-door neighbor out on the streets.</p>
            <p>SCMM is the largest mass-participation event with a whopping pool prize (USD 377,000) and commands an equally important place in the digital space. In January, the search for marathon related queries go up. Right from the dates to different marathons being conducted across cities. </p>
            <p>Your readers are in the zone too and motivated enough to bring out those running shoes. Not to forget, their health resolutions are still fresh in their minds.</p>
            <p>Brands can therefore, talk about <b>“how to prepare for marathon 2018”, “5 shocking things that happened at SCMM in the past”, “These pictures from SCMM 2017 will make you want to go sprint”, “Beginner’s guide to marathon training”, “How does running affect your body?”, “5 non-physical changes you experience during marathon training”</b> and <b>“5 heroes who didn’t let disability kill their marathon dream.”</b></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">3. Finances:</b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“On NYE alone I spent money enough to support a small village! But 2017 will be my year! Because the best time to invest is today”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/finance.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>The New Year is a new start for finances too, thereby prompting the <b>search for finance related terms to peak in January</b>. Salaried individuals start sampling tax-saving investment opportunities as most companies mark January as the deadline for declaring investments.</p>
            <p>As your readers attempt to balance the holiday season splurge, help them take wiser financial decisions by pushing <b>informative, demography-specific posts on personal finances.</b></p>
            <p>Some content ideas: <b>“What every 20-something should know about investments”, “Top 5 investors’ financial advice for 2017”, “Achieving financial freedom despite personal loans”, “10 sneaky ways to save Rs. 25,000 by December 2017”, “Demonetization and what it means for your gold”</b> etc. </p>
            <p>Also, formats like Infographics, blog posts with a healthy mix of images and text, short video clips work best for both breaking down traditionally intimidating information as well as quick content consumption.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">4. Budget 2017:</b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Seriously, what’s the future of my money?”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/budget.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Deviating from the colonial-era tradition of rolling out the Union Budget in the last week of February, 2017 will see budget announcement in January itself along with other structural reforms like merging railway and general budget.</p>
            <p>Considering the recent demonetization, your readers are seriously concerned about the future of their money. The budget is therefore, the perfect time to speak to them in their language and on matters they’re most concerned with, thereby emerging as a thought leader. </p>
            <p>From <b>demystifying Budget terms, educating readers on everyday necessities that will get cheaper/ expensive, impact of the budget on the country’s economy, tax slabs, unmet Budget promises of 2016, expectations from Budget 2017-18, to real-time information and tax calculators</b>, brands can create meaningful and engaging conversations to draw in massive readership.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">5. Pollution and Smog: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“It’s smoke.. it’s fog.. it’s smog!”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/pollution.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>The national capital has always been in the news for its perilously high levels of pollution, and the situation only worsens in winters.</p>
            <p>A perpetual blanket of smoky mist hangs in the air leading to difficulty in commuting, frequent flight and train delays, and serious health implications. The reason for this, besides the exhaust fumes emitted from the massive number of vehicles that Delhi is home to, is the burning of crops in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana.</p>
            <p>This is a great opportunity for brands to not just highlight their individual initiatives like <b>company carpooling, distributing anti-pollution masks</b> but also inform readers of the basics, like the cause, effect, and prevention.</p>
            <p>Content ideas: <b>“5 ways smog will negatively affect everyday functioning and how to counter that” “Yes, you’re mistaken, that’s not fog you see” “Can the air you breathe give you a heart attack?” “Delhi’s worst smog in 17 years, here’s how to stay safe” “3 ways to create a pollution-free tomorrow for your kids”</b> and <b>“5 government-led efforts to reduce pollution”.</b></p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">6. Bigg Boss Finale:</b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Dude, is Swami Om for real?!”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/bigboss.jpg" width="600px;">

            <p>Even people who have never seen a single episode of Bigg Boss (really, do you exist?) know who Swami Om is and those who religiously follow the show know how many eggs Bani J. eat daily.</p>
            <p>Every year, Bigg Boss takes the Indian television landscape by storm and this season was no different.</p>
            <p>From Gaurav and Bani’s ‘friendship’ to the M3 trio, there’s no escaping the Bigg Boss wave. As the season draws to an end, it will demand a bigger social media space and brands too can dip headfirst into the conversation and generate social media traction by <b>talking about individual contestants, speculating on the possible winner, the best moments from Bigg Boss 10, how much would it cost to create a replica of the Bigg Boss house, etc.</b></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">7. End of season sale:</b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“I just spent a fortune last month…oh look, 50% off!”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/endofseason.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p><b>Mall sales kickoff around this time</b> and despite strong competition from e-commerce, continue to lure in big numbers. This should mean a massive increase in online engagement as readers search for information ranging from the latest trends to the best sales.</p>
            <p>Some things your readers want to know: <b>‘At which store do I get this item for the least price?’ ‘Will I get it for a better price online?’ ‘What’s the store collection like?’</b> </p>
            <p>A multi-brand retailer can talk about the discounts on different brands. <b>A brand retailing fitness apparel can invite athletes and celebrity trainers to belt out tips or a makeup brand can run makeovers for shoppers.</b> A round up on which store at which mall has the best sale going on, a sneak peek of the store collection, posts on steal the celebrity look highlighting their own discounted items will work well.</p>
            <p>Additional content ideas: <b>“5 best malls in your city with jaw-dropping discounts” “10 outfit ideas on discount today that will make for a great Valentine’s Day pick” “Steal your favorite celebrity’s look at 50% off”, “5 things to do at the mall after your shopping spree”</b> etc.</p>

            <p>Talking on <b>the top fashion trends, industry-specific market predictions, how technology will disrupt everyday functioning, the highest-paying career options of 2017</b>, etc. will guarantee digital eyeballs.</p>
            <p>Also, in light of the recent demonetization, your readers would find topics like <b>‘How demonetization will affect India’s GDP this year?’, ‘What will a cashless India look like?’</b> etc. worth a read.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">9. Jaipur Literature Festival 19th – 23rd January </b></h2>

            <img src="/img/listicle_images/girlchild.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>From a skewed sex ratio in favor of men to rampant gender-based discrimination, there is a pressing need to talk about women empowerment today.</p>

            <p>As it’s also a national holiday, your readers are looking to put their feet up and celebrate at home. Therefore, content topics like <b>“5 patriotic movies/documentaries you can watch this Republic Day”, “Ways to celebrate Republic day”</b>, etc. will gain traction. </p>
            <p>Brands can also publish trivia and host quizzes like <b>“How much do you know about the constitution of India” “Which Indian freedom fighter said this?”</b>, etc.</p>

            <p>Marking the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi on 30th Jan 1948, Martyr’s Day is also observed to commemorate the lives of soldiers lost defending the country.</p>
            <p>Bearing in mind the recent terror attacks and subsequent other clashes at the border, there will be much conversation high on emotions. This is an area that a brand needs to be very careful about as issues like these cannot and must not be trivialized. </p>

            <img src="/img/listicle_images/pongal.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p><b>Lohri</b> is mainly a cultural celebration of winter solstice but some also associate it with harvest of the rabi crops. To be celebrated on <b>13th January</b>, which is the shortest day of winter, a distinct feature of this festival is the giant bonfire. This gives brand an opportunity for posts ranging from cultural messages to safety issues.</p>
            <p>Named after the popular rice dish of Tamil Nadu, <b>Pongal</b> – a four-day affair <b>(15th through 18th January)</b>– is a harvest celebration that also marks the changing seasons. <b>Both Lohri and Pongal are opportunities to enlighten your readers on gifting ideas, recipes, outfit ideas,</b> etc.</p>
            <p>Celebrated across different Indian cities, albeit by different names, <b>Makar Sankranti (14th January)</b> is a harvest festival wherein people discard the old for new – right from old clothes to longstanding enmity.

            <p>A patriotic freedom fighter and the man behind the quote <b>“Give me blood and I will give you freedom”</b> Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary is time for brands to highlight this visionary’s contribution in India’s freedom. </p>

            <p><b>Word Nerd Day (9th January)</b> is when the inner word nerd in your readers come out. Quizzes on <b>‘How big of a word nerd are you’ ‘Do you know the meaning of these 10 uncommon words?’ ‘5 words that even experts use/pronounce incorrectly’</b>, etc. will create a buzz.

            <p>Brands should attempt to add value as well as build relationship with some superior content sprinkled with fun-filled posts. </p>
            <p>It’s a brand new year for brands too to do content marketing right. Remember, listen to your audience, get into your readers’ minds, and promise content that not just cuts through the clutter but resonates with your readers and is worth their time.
