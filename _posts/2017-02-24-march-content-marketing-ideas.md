            <p>While it’s the onset of Spring in the north of the country, the Indian summer is beginning to make its presence felt south of the Vindhayas. So, for most of Mumbai and the southern cities, March is like the Loch Ness Monster. We’d like to believe it’s there but the sudden transition from sleeping with a blanket to sleeping with the air condition on full blast makes it difficult.</p>
            <p>Being as varied as is it is, March comes loaded with several content pegs for brands to engage with their audience.</p>
            <p>From important celebratory days for praising achievers to providing opportunities to opine on global affairs, March truly is the right time for brands to share their thoughts and efforts on important issues.</p>
            <p><b>We’ve rounded up 15 conversation-starting ideas you can leverage to do content right. So delve right in!</b></p>
        </span>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">1. Health: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Time to work for that summer body”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/health1.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Winter is forgiving with the need to pack on layers of clothes that camouflages in-built layers of fat, but summer isn’t!</p>
            <p>Remind your audience that getting that summer body takes hard work and time, and March is perfect to kick-start your Tabata or Zumba program.</p>
            <p>The changing season also wreaks havoc on the skin. Therefore, <b>posts and videos on skin care tips and celebrity beauty regime</b> works well and is also a great way to enjoy the cumulative benefit as the post picks up momentum later in the month with summer inching closer.</p>
            <p>Content ideas: <b>“Just how many glasses of water should you drink everyday” “5 must-have skin care products in your bag” “5 effortless ways men can take care of their skin this summer” “How to lose 7 kg by May” “How to get a leaner and fitter body”,</b> etc.</p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">2. Zero Discrimination Day 1st March: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Equality isn’t all of us being the same; it means our differences don’t matter”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/discrimination.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Zero Discrimination Day is observed to celebrate diversity and reject discrimination on grounds of age, sex, race, sexual orientation, and beliefs.</p>
            <p>At a time when the world is polarized and rife with discrimination of all sorts, brands can push <b>educative content against the stigma – whether racial, social or disease-associated</b>, albeit on a calibrated note.</p>
            <p>Generic posts on <b>how to eliminate discrimination at school/work place,</b> as well as digressing into specific areas like <b>“working towards higher gender parity”, “what Indian education institutes can do to make international students feel at home”</b>, etc. would make for a good read.</p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">3. World Wildlife Day, 3rd March: </b></h2>

            <p>A global observance, the theme of World Wildlife Day 2017 is <b>‘Listen to the Young Voices’</b>. With an attempt to educate and sensitize future leaders of the world towards protecting endangered species, this is an opportunity for brands to link youth empowerment and wildlife conservation in one.</p>
            <p>UN encourages mass participation through two ways – by <b>donating to Back a Ranger program</b> wherein you monetarily equip rangers who defend animals, especially the hapless species considered trophy elements, and two; by <b>signing pledges</b> urging governments to pass stricter laws.</p>
            <p>Content ideas: <b>“6 species that might go extinct by 2020”, “A day in the life of a trophy animal”, “5 fantastic ways governments deter wildlife hunting”, “How to ingrain compassion towards animals in children”, “5 hero kids’ stories that reaffirm our faith in a better tomorrow”.</b></p>

            <img src="/img/listicle_images/employee_appre.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>This is a great day to categorically appreciate employees for their contributions.</p>
            <p>Companies can host an event to praise employees who made a difference and publish about it on their blogs and social media.</p>
            <p>Thought-leadership posts on <b>keeping employees first, how can companies work towards better employee health, suggestions from employees to make work a fun place for them,</b> etc. showcases that brands care about their human assets.</p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">5. International Women’s Day 8th March: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“BeBoldForChange”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/womensday.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>THIS IS A BIG SOCIAL MEDIA DAY – PERIOD! One of the most important days of the month, International Women’s Day is a great way to push out light-hearted, emotional content praising the women in our lives and even take on serious issues like gender inequality.</p>
            <p>The theme for this year is <b>“Women in the changing world of work: Planet 50-50 by 2030”</b> reflects on the need for women empowerment, gender-responsive economic reforms and policies, and access to technology for the fairer sex.</p>
            <p>With women empowerment at the heart of international agendas for sustainability development, <b>brands can trigger massive user-generated content through contests and social media campaigns.</b> Quirky greetings, quotes on women, women achievers, ways to promote gender parity, especially at the grass root level are some talking points to build content around.</p>
            <p>Additionally, CSR activities like celebrating successful women at the work place will resonate well with your audience. Some content ideas: <b>“Women who made ISRO’s satellite launch a reality”, “7 everyday encounters women face that are actually sexist”, “10 boss lady tweets shattering sexism”, “This International Women’s Day, which important women in your life are you celebrating”,</b> etc.</p>

            <img src="/img/listicle_images/kidneyday.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>With the theme #moveforkidneys, this year’s campaigns primarily link obesity with kidney health.</p>
            <p>Not generally labeled a potent cause of kidney-related issues, obesity however, catalyzes the development of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) through triggering lifestyle diseases like hypertension and diabetes.</p>
            <p>Educating your audience about the same as well as giving them insights into keeping kidneys healthy is a safe bet to play. <b>Kidney-friendly food ideas, how much water to drink for healthy kidneys, how to test for kidney diseases, how can diabetics keep their kidneys healthy, kidney theft stories that shook the nation,</b> etc. will be a worthy read for your audience.</p>

            <p>The theme for World Water Day this year is ‘Water and Wastewater’. With a different theme each year, this day recognizes the need for fresh water for every individual in this world.</p>

            <p>To be celebrated on <b>25th March from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m.,</b> Earth Hour gives brands an opportunity to showcase their initiatives towards reducing carbon footprint. Pledging to save electricity and reduce wastage on social media as well as inviting readers to do the same would gain good traction.</p>
