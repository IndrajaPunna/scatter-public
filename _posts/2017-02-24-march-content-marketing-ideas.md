            <p>While it’s the onset of Spring in the north of the country, the Indian summer is beginning to make its presence felt south of the Vindhayas….So, for most of Mumbai and the southern cities, March is like the Loch Ness Monster. We’d like to believe it’s there but the sudden transition to sleeping with a blanket to sleeping with the air condition on full blast makes it hard to believe.</p>
            <p>Being as varied as is it is, March comes loaded with several content pegs for brands to engage with their audience.</p>
            <p>From important celebratory days for praising achievers to providing opportunities to opine on global affairs, March truly is the right time for brands to share their thoughts and efforts on important issues.</p>
            <p><b>We’ve rounded up XX conversation-starting ideas for brands. So delve right in!</b></p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">1. Health: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Time to work for that summer body”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/health1.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Winter is forgiving with the need to pack on layers of clothes that camouflages in-built layers of fat, but summer isn’t! Remind your audience that getting that summer body takes hard work and time, and March is the perfect time to kick-start your Tabata or Zumba program.</p>
            <p>The changing season also wreaks havoc on the skin. Therefore, <b>posts and videos on skin care tips and regime</b> works well and is also a great way to enjoy the cumulative benefit as the post picks up momentum later in the month as summer approaches.</p>
            <p>Content ideas: <b>“Just how many glasses of water should you drink everyday” “5 must-have skin care products in your bag” “5 effortless ways men can take care of their skin this summer” “How to lose 7 kg by May” “How to get a leaner and fitter body”,</b> etc. </p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">2. Zero Discrimination Day 1st March: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Equality isn’t all of us being the same; it means our differences don’t matter”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/discrimination.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Zero Discrimination Day is observed to celebrate diversity and reject discrimination on grounds of age, sex, race, sexual orientation, and beliefs.</p>
            <p>At a time when the world is polarized and rife with discrimination of all sorts, brands can push <b>educative content against the stigma – whether racial, social or disease-associated</b>, albeit on a calibrated note.</p>
            <p>Generic posts on how to eliminate discrimination at school/work place, as well as digressing into specific areas like <b>“working towards higher gender parity”, “what Indian education institutes can do to make international students feel at home”,</b> etc. would make for a good read.</p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">3. World Wildlife Day, 3rd March: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Protect animals or we’d only see them in alphabet books”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/wildlife.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>A global observance, the theme of World Wildlife Day 2017 is <b>‘Listen to the Young Voices’</b>. With an attempt to educate and sensitize future leaders of the world towards protecting endangered species, this is an opportunity for brands to link youth empowerment and wildlife conservation in one.</p>
            <p>UN encourages mass participation through two ways – by <b>donating to Back a Ranger program</b> wherein you monetarily equip rangers who defend animals, especially the hapless species considered trophy elements, and two; by <b>signing pledges</b> urging governments to pass stricter laws.</p>
            <p>Content ideas: <b>“6 species that might go extinct by 2020”, “A day in the life of a trophy animal”, “5 fantastic ways governments deter wildlife hunting”, “How to ingrain compassion towards animals in children”, “5 hero kids’ stories that reaffirm our faith in a better tomorrow”.</b></p>
