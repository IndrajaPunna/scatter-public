            <p>April might start with a joke but the month is not to be taken lightly.</p>
            <p>With tons of diverse content pegs to build on – something for every brand – April brings with itself a ton of content marketing opportunities for brands to set the right mood as the financial year kicks off.</p>
            <p>From fun days to social causes, here are 15 topics brands can talk on.</p>
        </span>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">1. April Fool’s Day 1st April: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Today, I will believe nothing and trust no one… wait, that’s like every other day”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/aprilfool.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Probably the only day where brands wouldn’t face backlash for being deceptive and fake. April Fool’s day is when your readers are taking a jibe at each other, playing pranks – some might go down south – and overall, looking to convivially ring in the new financial year.</p>
            <p>You could play it safe and inject humor with <b>brand-centric social posts or pull a prank</b> (in good taste) on one of your employees/co-workers and put it on social media. Or, you can go all out like these convincing brand hoaxes such as Honda’s first DIY car or Netflix’s fabricated sneak-peek of season 3 of House of Cards.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">2. World Autism Awareness Day 2nd April: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">#LightItUpBlue</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/autism.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>There are 18 million people with Autism in India and yet the prevalent stigma attached to it makes it difficult for those with this developmental disability to live a fulfilling and dignified life. </p>
            <p>Talks around <b>autism awareness, the need for equality, and expressing solidarity by pledging support to the cause</b> – monetarily and otherwise – will put your brand in good light. You can also use this day to opine on the <b>necessity for sensitizing mindsets</b> towards neurobehavioral conditions. </p>
            <p>Additionally, brands can organize activities like <b>walks for autism awareness</b> and encourage employees to <b>wear blue to show support</b> for its signature campaign called Light It Up Blue.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">3. World Health Day 7th April: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Depression: Let’s Talk”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/depression.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Every year, on World Health Day, WHO campaigns around one important health issue. This year’s theme is depression. Although used loosely in everyday conversations, depression is a critical concern that can strip away a person of their complete identity.</p>
            <p>The major concern, however, is the perceived shame associated with it. People shy away from public conversations on depression and counseling as it automatically deems someone mentally incapable of being an everyday person. Brands, with their strong positioning and reach, can help towards subverting and subsequently, shattering this belief.</p>
            <p>Posts on <b>awareness, how to say if you’re depressed, where to seek help, celebrities who suffered from depression and spoke about it, teenage depression, depression signs parents can look for in children, 5 things your depressed friend really wants you to do</b>, etc. will be well received.</p>
            <p>Brands can also come in the limelight by identifying the correlation of chronic stressful situations and depression, and encouraging good work-life balance for their employees.</p>

            <img src="/img/listicle_images/alcohol.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>There are some marked territories brands don’t venture into; alcohol being one of them. But, with drunk driving accidents, alcoholism, and health conditions brought on by prolonged alcohol abuse on the rise, there is a pressing need to converse on this. </p>
            <p>Data-backed posts on <b>drunk driving accidents, creating awareness, especially amongst teenagers, suggesting healthier alternatives to alcohol, publishing stories of survivors</b> (of drunk driving as well as alcoholism), <b>suggesting apps for monitoring alcohol consumption</b>, etc. will gain good traction on social media.</p>
            <p>Content ideas: <b>“How alcohol can rob you of a promising future”, “5 ways children are encouraged to abuse alcohol”, “5 effortless ways to keep yourself from binge drinking”, “5 ways to ensure your drunk friend doesn’t drive”, “3 signs of alcoholism”, “How to get sober in 90 days”</b>, etc. </p>

            <p>At a time when allegorical poetry is fast losing its foothold to lyrics that make no sense, the world needs more poetry. </p>
