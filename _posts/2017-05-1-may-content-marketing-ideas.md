            <h2><b style="color:#003366">1. Cricket Fever: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“The only type of fever to grip the entire country at once.”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/cricket_fever.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>From supporting your city in full gusto to defending your favourite cricketer on social media, you know it’s IPL season when your city-based identity comes out in full force. Each match offers power-packed entertainment, building up to the finals on May 21st.</p>
            <p>There's a lot brands can do to ease themselves into these passionate conversations. From match moments to memes, keep social media buzzing with constant updates and match-related and cricketer-related facts. Topics such as “Who are our celeb’s rooting for this IPL?”, “Epic game time snacks”, “What to wear to an IPL match?” etc. will be well received.</p>
            <p>Digressing from the world of IPL to ODIs, Ireland, Bangladesh, and New Zealand will play each other from the 12th through the 24th May, while England will compete with South Africa on the 24th of May. Cricket is surely hot this summer.</p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">2. Summer Vacations: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Not just for kids.”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/summer_vacations.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>While the mercury soars and schools shut their doors, it’s time to plan for family vacations or just stay indoors devouring the idiot box and other screens all month long. This is the time when your audiences are looking for travel inspirations, summer recipes, staycation ideas, and overall, ideas on how to beat the unforgiving heat.</p>
            <p>Searches around travel destinations peak during this time. Therefore, it makes sense to push posts such as ‘Top 10 destinations that are perfect for this summer” “Sync your summer vacation trips with the ongoing IPL matches” “How to plan a budget trip to popular destinations” “Offbeat trips you ought to take with your kids”, etc. </p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">3. World Asthma Day May 2nd: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“When every breath is a struggle.”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/world_asthma.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>With close to 20 million Indians suffering from asthma, World Asthma Day is a good time to spread awareness about this respiratory condition, as well as talk about its prevention and precautions. </p>
            <p>Educative posts on the symptoms of asthma, predictive and preventive approach to asthma management, available treatments and their costs, how the precariously rising levels of pollution in certain Indian cities increase the chances of asthma, etc. would create a buzz online.</p>
            <p>Additional content ideas: “What should be in your asthmatic kid’s emergency kit?” “Are your lifestyle choices increasing your chances of getting asthma?” and “Are you safe from asthma within the four walls of your home?”</p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">4. Rabindranath Tagore Jayanti May 7th: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“A legend transcending eras.”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/rabindranath.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>The birth anniversary of noted scholar and noble laureate Rabindranath Tagore clashes with the 25th day of Boishakhi, popularly known as Poncheeshee Boisakh. This day is celebrated with much fervour, especially in Kolkata and Shantiniketan, with cultural programs and singing of Rabindra Sangeet. </p>
            <p>Engaging conversations around Tagore’s contribution to literature & music, quotes from his more popular works, excerpts from his powerful speeches like the one at Berlin’s modern-day Humboldt University and lesser-known facts about the legend are great content marketing opportunities.</p>
            <p>Interactive content on social media, contests like "How well do you know Tagore?" with questions such as “Name the two countries’ national anthems were written by Tagore?” are positive ways to join the celebration.</p>
