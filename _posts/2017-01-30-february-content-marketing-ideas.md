            <p>By now, your users have forgotten most of their new year’s resolutions, the buzz has died down, and routine life is picking pace. </p>
            <p>That being said, the shortest month of the year comes with a long list of content marketing ideas to prompt good interaction with your readers and strengthen your digital foothold.</p>
            <p>So let’s dive right in and start planning to wow your users with superior content throughout the month.</p>
            <p>We’ve rounded up <b style="color: #FF4500">12 content pegs to build around this February.</b></p>
        </span>
        <div>
            <h2><b style="color:#003366">1. World Cancer Day 4th February: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Do I know enough about the C word?”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/world_cancer.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>A global event uniting the world in the fight against cancer, on World Cancer Day, your readers are looking up information on the types, causes, and treatments of cancer.</p>
            <p>With an annual 8.2 million cancer-related deaths worldwide and three people dying of the disease every minute in India, this day provides excellent opportunity to push informative content like <b>‘Quick breast self-exam (BSE) women should do every week’, ‘5 facts about cancer you need to know’ ‘Is your job putting you at a higher risk of cancer’, “Bizarre cancer myths that worry doctors’, ‘Can we imagine a cancer-free future with gene mapping and subsequent personalized treatment?’</b> etc.</p>
            <p>Your readers would definitely find stats-based posts a worthy read. This is also the time when they have made fresh resolutions, which are either being pursued with dimmed enthusiasm or put on the back burner. Therefore, posts like <b>‘Small lifestyle changes that help prevent cancer’, ‘Can an hour at the gym lower the risk of breast cancer’, ‘Not just lung cancer, smoking can cause 12 types of cancer!’</b>, etc. promise good readership and make your users reconsider pursuing those resolutions.</p>
            <p>Everyone loves an inspiring and tear-jerking survivor story. Therefore, brands can also publish video snippets and blog posts of the hardships and triumph of cancer survivors.</p>
            <p>Lending support to the three-year World Cancer Day campaign that started in 2016 with the theme <b>We Can. I Can.</b> by talking about how they can collectively and individually lessen the impact of cancer is again a good idea. Reeling in the rural sector and throwing light on the lack of information as well as treatment opportunities in the underdeveloped parts of the country would be a good conversation starter in the digital space.</p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">2. International Day of Women and Girls in Science 11th February: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Yes, we can!”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/international_women.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Brand participation in the already-buzzing conversation on the topic online is a good show of their attempt to promote gender parity in the field of science</p>
            <p>The number one question that cross your readers’ mind in this context is <b>‘just why are there such  few women in the field of science?’</b> Pushing content around <b>debunking myths like women don’t have an aptitude for science, they’d have to take a sabbatical to raise children</b>, etc. will generate good online traction.</p>
            <p>Some content ideas: <b>‘Ways to encourage your daughter to develop interest in science at a young age’, ‘5 scientific discoveries by women’ ‘Where are the IIT women graduates of the 90s’</b>, etc.</p>

            <h2><b style="color:#003366">3. Don’t Cry Over Spilled Milk Day 11th February: </b></h2>
            <p><b style="color: #be6837">“Figuratively spilling milk hurts more than literally spilling beer, or wait, does it?”</b></p>
            <img src="/img/listicle_images/spilled_milk.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Not a commonly celebrated day but Don’t Cry Over Spilled Milk Day provides an excellent opportunity to talk to your readers about either redoing things or starting afresh.</p>
            <p>Every brand, irrespective of the industry they cater to, can say something useful.</p>
            <p>From <b>‘How to restart your New Year’s resolutions’ to ‘What to do if you don’t clear a competitive exam’</b>, there’s an abundance of conversations stemming from the idea of crying over spilled milk.</p>
            <p>There’s also an opportunity to build content in the context of depression and suicide, albeit on an empathetic and calibrated note. With the number of depressed Indians on the rise and discussion of such subjects gaining momentum on the internet, brands can contribute their two cents along the lines of <b>“3 things that get you out when you hit rock bottom”, “5 extraordinary people who are the epitome of ‘past doesn’t dictate future’”</b>, and <b>“How to be your child’s best friend and confidant?”</b></p>

            <p>On her birth anniversary, brands can extoll her in the context of <b>women empowerment and what modern Indian women can learn from her. Lesser-known facts, key achievements, and her contribution as a freedom fighter</b> all make for interesting reads. </p>
            <p>Also, <b>extracts from her literary work can be published on social media</b>, inviting readers to contribute their interpretation and opinions on the same. </p>

            <img src="/img/listicle_images/radio.jpg" width="600px;">
            <p>Once predicted to become obsolete, radio still continues to be an important medium of entertainment and advertisement. On World Radio Day, posts on <b>‘historical radio broadcasts of all time’, ‘the funniest moments on radio’, ‘the most-requested songs on radio through the years’, ‘favorite RJs and their biggest radio moments’</b>, etc. will be good talking points.</p>
            <p>Additionally, brands can invite users to share their personal favorite songs that they first heard/requested for on the radio or have a memory attached to.</p>
